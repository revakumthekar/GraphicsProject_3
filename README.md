----- Project 3: Just Keep Moving! Pt 2 -----
Description: This project is a canvas drawing made up of multiple polygons, lines, and arcs that create an image of a car zooming on by while time moves very quickly in the background

Files: project_3.html
project_3.js

## project_3.html

This file is a basic html file that sets up the canvas and connects to the .js file that goes along with it.

## project_3.js

This file is the javascript file that creates all of the components displayed onto the canvas. This is where the multiple polygons, lines, and arcs are created and where car and clock are animated to keep moving. The transformations of the polygons are done through matrix transformations

- To execute the file, all you must do is open the html file in the browser of your choice, and the components should work as they were meant to be displayed.
